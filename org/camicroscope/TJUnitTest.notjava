This can contain TJUnitTest.java from BioFormats repository, with a line added "package org.camicroscope", and then called from BFBridge.java static main() function for graalvm tracer to expect to generate all jni definitions. We currently don't need compressor definitions; we only read. If this is needed, bring TJUnitTest.java with the package line and uncomment the runner from main() to be run with the tracer.
